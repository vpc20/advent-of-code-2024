    "Understanding the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We're given a list of available towel patterns and a target design. The goal is to determine the number of ways to combine these patterns to form the exact design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming Approach\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. In this case, we'll break down the problem of creating the entire design into smaller subproblems of creating prefixes of the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dp Array\n",
    "The dp array is used to store the number of ways to create a specific prefix of the design. The index i of the dp array corresponds to the length of the prefix, and the value at dp[i] represents the number of ways to create that prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing the dp Array\n",
    "    dp[0] = 1: This means there's only one way to create an empty design (i.e., no towels).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Main Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The two nested loops iterate over the design and the patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Outer Loop (Iterating over the Design):\n",
    "        i: Represents the current index in the design.\n",
    "    Inner Loop (Iterating over Patterns):\n",
    "        k: Represents the index of the current pattern.\n",
    "        Pattern Matching: Checks if the current pattern matches the substring of the design starting from i - pattern_length.\n",
    "        Updating dp[i]: If a match is found, we add the number of ways to create the prefix ending at i - pattern_length (stored in dp[i - pattern_length]) to dp[i]. This is because we can append the current pattern to any of the ways to create the shorter prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result is stored in dp[len(design)], which represents the number of ways to create the entire design.\n",
